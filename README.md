# Machine Learning in the Chinese Stock Market Reproduction

This project is affiliated with the [Deep Video Lab at the Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking University](https://deepvideolab.top/en/).

- Read the research papers on time series analysis models such as Informer, Autoformer, and FEDformer, and replicate the model code to test the model's performance.

- Based on the ideas of video codecs, design a dataset classification algorithm that adaptively switches to the optimal time series analysis model for different types of datasets.

- Maintain the laboratory's quantitative factor library, optimize the factor calculation code, and regularly update the factors. Additionally, conduct feature engineering based on model ideas.

- Use the Backtrader quantitative backtesting framework to backtest the model's prediction results, and provide result analysis and directions for improvement.
